Todo: 
Permissions:
Input monitoring.  - Could we use different setting ?
Accessibility permissions. Go to Privacy & Security → Accessibility
  Add your terminal app (Terminal.app, iTerm, VS Code, etc.)

Download The model at the beginning itself. Keep it somewhere safe. 
LLM to fine tune it. 

Size of the models shown in statuys bar are inaccuarte

The first inference is taking some time. Maybe we should load the model when we are launching the app. 

It's not checkiing and updating permissions status automatically. Even after providing it. 


First time steup dialog:
1. After selecting the modela nd pressing download, it's getting stuck there. We should probably download it in the background.



I want to make a change to the app. 
We are currently showing status of the model as downloading.
The feature i want to build is to show percentage of the model being downloaded. 
Can you do this ?
